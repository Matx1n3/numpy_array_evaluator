# numpy_array_evaluator
This repository contains a Python script (numpy_array_evaluator.py) that leverages NumPy to perform efficient evaluation and processing of arrays. The script includes functions designed to evaluate elements within arrays using parallel processing techniques, enabling faster computations on multi-core systems. The script's modular design allows for easy integration into projects requiring array evaluation and manipulation, providing a foundational toolset built on NumPy's capabilities.

## Key Features
    - Parallel evaluation of NumPy arrays for faster processing.
    - Optimized for multi-core systems to enhance computational efficiency.
    - Easily integrable into projects requiring array evaluation and manipulation.

## How to Use
The `func` parameter must follow a specific format to be compatible with `evaluate_all_elements`. It should accept two parameters: `instance` (representing the array element to be processed) and `args` (a tuple containing any other required arguments).

If your existing function doesn't conform to this format, you can create a wrapper function to adapt it.

### Example
```python
# Example of a function that doesn't match the required format
def my_non_compatible_function(element, arg1, arg2):
    # Your existing logic here
    return result

# Create a wrapper function to match the expected format
def my_wrapper_function(instance, args):
    return my_non_compatible_function(instance, *args)
